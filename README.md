# Introduction
It is a Java implementation of the pac-man game made for the college subject "SCC0604 - Object-Oriented Programming" at the University of SÃ£o Paulo - USP. 
The main goal in implementing such project was to apply the four pillars of OOP design: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

# Ghosts behavior
The approach used to control the behavior of the ghosts was not equal to the used in the original game. In fact, it was a way simpler. Here, Inky and Clyde just move randomly in the maze while Blinky and Pinky keep chasing the pac-man. To execute the ghosts' movements, each cell of the maze was considered as a node of a graph and the Breadth First Search algorithm was used to find the shortest path between one ghost and the point such ghost  intended to reach.
